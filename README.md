* **The goal is to create a model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response 
(dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (regressor or independent variable)**


* **The relationships are modelled using linear functions whose unknown parameters are estimated from the data**


* **The model is fitted using least squares errors parameter estimation by minimizing the sum of the 
squares of residuals (a residual being the difference between an observed value and the fitted value provided by a model**
