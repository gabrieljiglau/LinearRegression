* **The goal is to create a model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response 
(dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (regressor or independent variable)**


* **The relationships are modelled using linear functions whose unknown parameters are estimated from the data**


* **For uni-variate linear regression, the model is fitted using least squares errors by minimizing the sum of the 
squares of residuals (a residual being the difference between an observed value and the fitted value provided by the
model)**


* **For multi-variate linear regression, the objective is to minimize a global error (mean squared error)
by using gradient descent**
